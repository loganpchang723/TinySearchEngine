## Common Module

This is the directory that has code to be shared between the *crawler*, *indexer*, and *querier* modules. This includes code for initializing the `pageDirectory` and saving files there, the `index` struct module, and the code to process words encounted by the search engine.

### Compilation
To compile the *common* module and build the `common.a` library, simply run `make` in the `common` directory or run `make` in the parent directory to compile all modules.
